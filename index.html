    I'm the only child of Kizashi and Mebuki Haruno. I had a healthy childhood, raised by my parents without any serious tragedy or complications, unlike her friends. When she entered Konoha's Academy, a few of the girls in her class started picking on me because my broad forehead. I tried to combat their teasing by hiding my forehead with bangs, but this caused the girls to bully me even more. alyssa, one of her classmates, saw this, and defended me from my bullies and encouraged me to embrace my big forehead rather than hide it. </p>
